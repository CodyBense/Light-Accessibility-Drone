All information pertaining to the function and control of the claw will be found in this branch.

The claw will be controlled by an Arduino Nano, mounted to the drone, that will recieve a signal from an Arduino Uno through a nRF24L01 2.4 GHz module. The signal will proctor the nano to either open or close the claw.
