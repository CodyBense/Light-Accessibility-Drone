# Light-Accessibility-Drone
Georgia Southern University - Senior Capstone Spring 2022

The droneâ€™s main purpose is to assist people with limited mobility to accomplish tasks such as grabbing items and moving them around. The movement of the drone will be controlled primarily using hand gestures, but it also will include an attachment that will assist with picking up the objects with a claw attached to the drone and be controlled by a brain-computer interface. By utilizing both control methods we plan to create a simple, easy to grasp appliance that people with mobility problems can use for assistance with day to day activities.
